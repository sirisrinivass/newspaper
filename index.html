    <p id="About Narendra modi"><mark>pm narendra modi political life</mark> <br><b>Governance and other initiatives
            Modi's first year as PM saw significant centralisation of power.[158][237] Modi, who initially lacked a
            majority in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Indian Parliament, passed a number of ordinances to enact
            his policies, leading to further centralisation of power.[238] His administration enacted a bill to increase
            its control over the appointment of judges and reducing that of the judiciary.[38] In December 2014, he
            abolished the Planning Commission, replacing it with the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI
            Aayog),[239][240] </b> concentrating the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the
        PM.[238][239][240][241][242] The Planning Commission had in previous years been criticised for creating
        inefficiency in the government and of not fulfilling its role of improving social welfare but since the economic
        liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social
        justice.[240][243]

        In its first year of administration, the Modi government launched investigations through the Intelligence Bureau
        into numerous civil society organisations and foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on the grounds these
        organisations were slowing economic growth. The investigations were criticised as a witch hunt. International
        humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres, and environmental nonprofit organisation Sierra Club and
        Avaaz were among the groups that were investigated </p>

    <p id="About Outsourcing">What Is Outsourcing?
        <b> Outsourcing is the business practice of hiring a party outside a company to perform services or create goods
            that were traditionally performed in-house by the company's own employees and staff.</b> Outsourcing is a
        practice usually undertaken by companies as a cost-cutting measure. As such, it can affect a wide range of jobs,
        ranging from customer support to manufacturing to the back office.

        Outsourcing was first recognized as a business strategy in 1989 and became an integral part of business
        economics throughout the 1990s.

        The practice of outsourcing is subject to considerable controversy in many countries
    </p>
    Those opposed argue that it has caused the loss of domestic jobs, particularly in the manufacturing sector.
    Supporters say it creates an incentive for businesses and companies to allocate resources where they are most
    effective, and that outsourcing helps maintain the nature of free-market economies on a global scale.

    KEY TAKEAWAYS
    Companies use outsourcing to cut labor costs, including salaries for their personnel, overhead, equipment, and
    technology.
    Outsourcing is also used by companies to dial down and focus on the core aspects of the business, spinning off the
    less critical operations to outside organizations.

        How is Plastic Recycled? A Step by Step Guide to Recycling
        A critical stage in recycling plastic is shredding or grinding plastic into smaller flakes. The washed and
        sorted plastic is sent through shredding machines where it is ground into smaller pieces of plastic. Further
        sorting may take place to ensure a pure stream of material is produced.</p><b>What are 4 ways to reduce plastic
        waste?
        Say no to disposable plastic cutlery, plastic straws and other single-use plastics. Avoid plastics that cannot
        be recycled if other alternatives exist. Avoid products with excess or unnecessary plastic packaging. Adopt
        reusable items such as water bottles, shopping bags, keep cups and travel cutlery.</b>
